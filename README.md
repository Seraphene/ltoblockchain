To do:
Highest-value, easiest tasks (prioritized)
Create the GitHub repo + basic README + Issues board. (30–45 min)

Add README.md with MVP scope and team roles.

Scaffold a minimal Express backend that: accepts a file, computes SHA-256, saves file to uploads/, stores metadata in a local JSON DB (db.json), and exposes a verification endpoint. (1.5–3 hrs)

Build a tiny React page: file input + submit button + show response (file id, hash). Add simple verify form to paste/enter hash and show valid/invalid. (1–2 hrs)

Dockerize the backend and run with docker compose so the whole stack runs anywhere. (30–60 min)

Prepare 5 sample PDF/JPG files and demo the flow: upload → get hash/id → verify. Record short video or screenshots. (30–60 min)

(Optional next) Replace db.json with SQLite or Postgres and add basic tests/CI. (~2–4 hrs)


Notes:
Must use branches to request pull and commit
Mainly to avoid overwriting codes
